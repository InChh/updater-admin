# Updater Admin Implementation - Checkpoint

- Task ID: 2026-07-14-updater-admin-implementation
- Current todo: Batch 0 baseline commit and isolated worktree
- Active slice: Foundation preflight
- Blocked on: none
- Next step: Run Intent and scaffold verification, commit baseline, create .worktrees/codex-updater-admin-implementation

## DriftCheckDraft

- Scope status: Batch 0 only; no business code
- Compatibility status: New /api/v1 boundary unchanged; no legacy compatibility
- Retirement status: Demo routes retained until Batch 14
- New risk signals:
- Repository has no initial commit; baseline commit is required before worktree creation
- Advisory decision: continue

## Checkpoint Update

- Current todo: Batch 1: establish tooling, dependencies, Intent allowlist, and deterministic test harness
- Active slice: Batch 1 tooling and test harness
- Completed todos:
- Batch 0: isolated worktree created; pnpm install --frozen-lockfile, check, typecheck, baseline test, and Netlify build passed
- Evidence refs:
- baseline commit c300d38
- fresh worktree check/typecheck/test/build pass on 2026-07-14
- Blocked on: none
- Next step: Load current TanStack Intent CLI guidance and dispatch Batch 1 implementer

## DriftCheckDraft

- Scope status: Batch 0 only established isolated execution and verification; no business scope changes.
- Compatibility status: No legacy compatibility paths added.
- Retirement status: Generated demos remain temporarily and are scheduled for removal in Batch 14.
- New risk signals:
- none
- Advisory decision: continue

## Checkpoint Update

- Current todo: Batch 2: validated environment access, Drizzle schema, and initial migration
- Active slice: Batch 2 database foundation
- Completed todos:
- Batch 0: isolated worktree and fresh baseline verification
- Batch 1: dependencies, Intent allowlist, deterministic Vitest/DB/Playwright harness; spec and quality reviews passed
- Evidence refs:
- Batch 1: offline frozen install, intent:list, check, typecheck, 2 Vitest tests, Playwright dry-run, build, diff-check all exit 0
- Batch 1 spec review PASS; quality review PASS after test-discovery and hardening fixes
- Blocked on: none
- Next step: Implement the approved schema/environment slice from current local Drizzle, Neon, and Better Auth APIs

## DriftCheckDraft

- Scope status: Batch 1 stayed within tooling, dependency, environment typing, and test-harness scope.
- Compatibility status: No Billing, tenancy, legacy-client compatibility, or business API surface added.
- Retirement status: Scaffold demos intentionally remain until real TanStack owners exist and Batch 14 retires them.
- New risk signals:
- none
- Advisory decision: continue
